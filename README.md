### Spring Boot Simple auction network system

------

This is a rough auction net system, so you should not pay attention to the back-end technology, this is just to practice front-end technology.

**Project Structure**:

1. folder pmai：The backend engineering
2. file SQL2.sql：MySQL database script
3. The rest are the front-end project-related files

##### Technology stack :(front and rear end separation):

- Backend：springboot

- front end：vue/cli+vue+element ui,

- database：MySQL

------

##### Run the Project

Attention please：The front end is a vue/cli setup project, so make sure you have NPM installed to download dependencies

We recommend that you use vs code to run your project
